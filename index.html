        <p>
          8 years of experience in web and mobile technologies. Adept of
    maintainable and simple software in search of challenging problems,
    striving to learn new stuff and share knowledge at every opportunity.
    Being web accessibility advocate I assign user experience a top priority.
    Able to effectively manage myself as well as collaborate as a part of a productive team.
    With experience in FinTech, I understand what robust software truly means.
    When the money of clients and a company's audits are at stake, there is no room for error.
    "Testing in production" is not an optionâ€”software in production must be solid and reliable.
    I am eager to explore and learn new domains, with a particular interest in
    opportunities within the medical field.
